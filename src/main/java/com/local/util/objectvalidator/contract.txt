To add more checked constraints:
1- Create your constraint as an @annotation and annotate it by @ValidatedBy("full.validator.class.name")
2- The constraint annotation should have a message("String message to be shown")
3- Create the validator class by implementing Validator and public isValid(Object)
Note: This does not work on inherited annotated fields
